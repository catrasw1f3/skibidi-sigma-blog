I love any type of art. I like drawing, crafting, and music.
I love cooking and baking. Honestly I just like making things in general. I make a lot of things.
I LOVE fairies and anything fantasy-like.
My favorite colors are green and purple, and I HATE the color blue.
Strawberries are really cool. Same with cats."
