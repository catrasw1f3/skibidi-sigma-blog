### Homework Problem: Understanding JavaScript Variables 

### <span style="color: pink; text-shadow: 2px 2px 5px pink;"> Creating Variables</span>


1. **Create three variables as an object variable**:
   - A variable called `studentName` that stores your name as a string.
   - A variable called `age` that stores your age as a number.
   - A variable called `isStudent` that stores a boolean value indicating whether you are a student (use `true` or `false`).

   2. **Create a function variable that displays that your favorite song is playing**:
   
      - A variable called `favoriteSong` that stores the name of your favorite song.
      - A variable called `songArtist` that stores the song's artist.
      - A function called `playFavoriteSong` that logs a message saying "Now playing [favoriteSong] by [songArtist]".



3. **Using the variables you created**, write a sentence using `console.log()` to display:
   - Your name.
   - Your age.
   - Whether you are a student.
   - An output that states that your favorite song is now playing


   Example output:
My name is [Your Name], I am [Your Age] years old, and it is [true/false] that I am a student. 
Now playing Champion by Kanye West
