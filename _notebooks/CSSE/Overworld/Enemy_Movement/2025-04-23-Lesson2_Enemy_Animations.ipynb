    "This lesson will be based on your ability to create creative animations as our first lesson. If you recall, we created an animation that happens to the player when it collides with the enemy Creeper! Now, instead of working on an animation for the player, the enemy is the one that will have an animation instead. \n",

    "\n",
    "We want to make our games as interesting and immersive as possible, meaning adding animations and features into our game that will make it more interesting and engaging to play. By adding an animation to the enemy, it makes it seem more intimidating than a goofy creature bouncing around your screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we will teach some code that we used in our own demo to give you an idea of what to do. These will be done in blocks."
