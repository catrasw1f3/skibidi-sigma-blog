    "# Introduction\n",
    "When I first came to this class, I was very unsure of what I was doing. I'd considered dropping it many times (sorry Mr. Mortensen) but to be honest, I am glad I didn't. Without this class, there are so many skills and so many amazing people I would have never came to know. Throughout this class, I have learned many things; not only hard skills in coding, but soft skills, like presenting work and communicating with a team, thanks to the heavy group environment. This blog is an overview of all I have learned throughout CSSE2. "

    "# Overview of Work\n",
    "Throughout this trimester, I have brought much to my team, dedicating much of my time and effort. This includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Enemies** - Created custom enemies that allow for an immersive-user experience; fully fledged with their own features. This includes:\n",
    "- *Randomly moving enemies* - Allows for a factor of suspense, keeping the player invested in the game and creating an objective for the player.\n",
    "- *Reactions for enemies* - Creates a more immersive experience for the player (also, it stops the game from feeling like a boring bunch of code).\n",
    "- *Enemy animations* - A simple and fun way to add interest to our game. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Platformer** - Created a simple platformer level that continues on from our original RPG level, creating diversity within our game.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lessons** - Created easily understandable and simple lessons that allow for coders to learn from our code.\n",
    "- This also includes a soft skill of being able to present to many in a digestible way, also being open to any type of question and responding in a teachable manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bonus: Sprite Sheets** - Creating custom sprite sheets, creating the \"homemade\" feel, as well as giving our game a greater sense of uniqueness."

    "# Certification of Articulation Success\n",
    "I have successfully integrated many different aspects of code into both my personal game and the team game, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Software Engineering Practices:\n",
    "*Planning changes, checklists, burndowns, coding with comments, building help documentation*\n",
    "While working with a team, it is important to maintain proper communication throughout the group. This is why creating plans, checklists, communicating changes, coding with comments, as well as help documentations and burndowns are so important. There are many instances of this communication in our code, like in our bee motion method:\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "// Bee random motion logic\n",
    "let beeBuzzAngle = 0;\n",
    "function updateBeeMotion() {\n",
    "  beeSpriteData.x += beeSpriteData.direction.x * beeSpriteData.speed;\n",
    "  // Bounce off canvas edges\n",
    "  if (beeSpriteData.x < 0) {\n",
    "    beeSpriteData.x = 0;\n",
    "    beeSpriteData.direction.x = 1;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  if (beeSpriteData.x > canvas.width - beeSpriteData.width) {\n",
    "    beeSpriteData.x = canvas.width - beeSpriteData.width;\n",
    "    beeSpriteData.direction.x = -1;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  // Occasionally change direction\n",
    "  if (Math.random() < 0.03) {\n",
    "    beeSpriteData.direction.x *= -1;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  // Animate sprite (if you have multiple frames)\n",
    "  beeSpriteData.frameCounter++;\n",
    "  if (beeSpriteData.frameCounter >= beeSpriteData.ANIMATION_RATE) {\n",
    "    beeSpriteData.frameX = (beeSpriteData.frameX + 1) % 1; // Set to number of frames if animated\n",
    "    beeSpriteData.frameCounter = 0;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  beeBuzzAngle += 0.1;\n",
    "  beeSpriteData.y = 100 + Math.sin(beeBuzzAngle) * 20; // 200 is base Y, 20 is amplitude\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Or you can look at our chats in our shared groupchat on slack, which has most of the plans and ideas we've made (I'm half-joking).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Software Development Lifecycle Practices:\n",
    "*Source control, forking, branching, building, testing and verification, pull requests, merging/integrating, deployment*\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with a group, it is crucial to keep track of changes made by each of group members. Being with a group has taugh me how to make use of the many features on both VS Code and GitHub that allow all of us to keep track of our group's progress when working on things. Forking, branching, building, testing and verification, merging/integrating, deployment; these are all ways of making sure independently that changes made to a piece of code works before integrating it into a larger piece of code, allowing for an organized manner of distributing tasks among many. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Retrospective Engineering Practices:\n",
    "*Presentation, live reviews, demos, code reviews, revising plans*\n",
    "\n",
    "Being in this class has taught me much about being able to present code. This is much more a soft skill, yet is still very very important to my growth in this class, as presenting (not only code) is generally just a great skill to have, and is very important in many other fields of life. Things like lessons, live reviews, presenting at N@tM have all taught me how to be a great presenter that not only shows off code, but keeps the audience engaged.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Types\n",
    "*Numbers, strings, booleans, arrays, JSON objects*\n",
    "There are many instances of these data types in my code. Data types are crucial for storing important information in code so it can be later referenced. An example of this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "// Rat Guide data\n",
    "    const sprite_src_guide = path + \"/images/gamify/king.png\"; // be sure to include the path\n",
    "    const sprite_greet_guide_intro = \"\"; //not needed for right now\n",
    "    const sprite_greet_guide_info = \"\"; \n",
    "    const dialogueSystem = this.dialogueSystem;\n",
    "    const sprite_data_guide = {\n",
    "      id: 'Rat Guide',\n",
    "      greeting_intro: sprite_greet_guide_intro,\n",
    "      greeting_info: sprite_greet_guide_info,\n",
    "      src: sprite_src_guide,\n",
    "      SCALE_FACTOR: 10,  // adjust this based on your scaling needs\n",
    "      ANIMATION_RATE: 100,\n",
    "      pixels: { width: 1200, height: 1580 },\n",
    "      INIT_POSITION: { x: width * (7 / 8), y: height - (height / PLAYER_SCALE_FACTOR) }, \n",
    "      orientation: { rows: 1, columns: 1 },\n",
    "      down: { row: 0, start: 0, columns: 1 },   \n",
    "      hitbox: { widthPercentage: 0.1, heightPercentage: 0.2 },\n",
    "      reaction: function () {\n",
    "        dialogueSystem.showDialogue(`King: \"Welcome to the Boiling Isles! Although charming, we need to find a way back home. Why not explore the town?\" (Press 'E' to continue)`); // using custome dialogue system instead of alert\n",
    "        console.log(\"reacted with tomb guard ishfjhersfiqwe\")\n",
    "      },\n",
    "      interact: () => {\n",
    "        if (gameEnv.gameControl) {\n",
    "          // goes back to the gamecontrol level classes array\n",
    "          gameEnv.gameControl.currentLevelIndex = 1;\n",
    "          gameEnv.gameControl.transitionToLevel();\n",
    "        }\n",
    "        console.log(\"going to town level\")\n",
    "      }\n",
    "    }; \n",
    "```\n",
    "The sprite data that is defined in almost, if not every level of the Adventure Game is a great example on how we use data types to store information. There are instances of numbers, strings, JSON objects, yet not so much booleans or arrays, but you get the idea. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Operations:\n",
    "*String operations, mathematical operations, boolean expressions*\n",
    "Though there are not many string operations in my code, an example of one is found in the sprite data of many of the NPCs:\n",
    "```js\n",
    "const sprite_src_guide = path + \"/images/gamify/king.png\";\n",
    "```\n",
    "Mathematical operations, there are many more instances of, but here is one that is also found in the sprite data:\n",
    "```js\n",
    "INIT_POSITION: { x: width * (7 / 8), y: height - (height / PLAYER_SCALE_FACTOR) }, \n",
    "```\n",
    "And an example of a boolean expression that is not found in my code:\n",
    "```js\n",
    "// Reverse direction if the guard reaches the max distance\n",
    "            if (this.INIT_POSITION.x > initialX + maxDistance || this.INIT_POSITION.x < initialX - maxDistance) {\n",
    "                direction *= -1;\n",
    "    \n",
    "                // Flip the sprite horizontally based on direction\n",
    "                const spriteElement = document.getElementById(this.id); // Ensure the sprite has an ID matching its `id` property\n",
    "                if (spriteElement) {\n",
    "                    spriteElement.style.transform = direction === -1 ? 'scaleX(1)' : 'scaleX(-1)';\n",
    "                }\n",
    "            }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Control Structure:\n",
    "*Iteration, conditions, nested conditions*\n",
    "An example of an iteration:\n",
    "```js\n",
    "quizData.questions.forEach(question => {\n",
    "        const correctAnswer = question.options[question.correctAnswer];\n",
    "        const shuffledOptions = question.options\n",
    "          .map(option => ({ option, sort: Math.random() }))\n",
    "          .sort((a, b) => a.sort - b.sort)\n",
    "          .map(({ option }) => option);\n",
    "        question.correctAnswer = shuffledOptions.indexOf(correctAnswer);\n",
    "        question.options = shuffledOptions;\n",
    "      });\n",
    "```\n",
    "A condition:\n",
    "```js\n",
    "if (callback) callback();\n",
    "```\n",
    "And a nested condition:\n",
    "```js\n",
    "if (this.INIT_POSITION.x > initialX + maxDistance || this.INIT_POSITION.x < initialX - maxDistance) {\n",
    "  direction *= -1;\n",
    "  if (spriteElement) {\n",
    "    spriteElement.style.transform = direction === -1 ? 'scaleX(1)' : 'scaleX(-1)';\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "(And yes, I did use this for my boolean expression as well)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input/Output\n",
    "*HTML5 input, validation, Key events, Document Object Model (DOM)*\n",
    "An example of HTML5 input/validation/key events:\n",
    "```js\n",
    "keypress: { up: 87, left: 65, down: 83, right: 68 } \n",
    "// → mapped to keyboard keys W, A, S, D\n",
    "```\n",
    "DOM Manipulation:\n",
    "```js\n",
    "const spriteElement = document.getElementById(this.id); // Ensure the sprite has an ID matching its `id` property\n",
    "        if (spriteElement) {\n",
    "                    spriteElement.style.transform = direction === -1 ? 'scaleX(1)' : 'scaleX(-1)';\n",
    "        }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classes\n",
    "*Writing classes, creating methods, instantiating objects, using objects, calling methods, parameters, return values*\n",
    "An example of writing classes:\n",
    "well... all of the game levels are classes. Infact, all of the .js files are classes. Here is a very short one:\n",
    "```js\n",
    "class Background {\n",
    "    constructor(data, gameEnv) {\n",
    "        this.image = new window.Image();\n",
    "        this.image.src = data.src;\n",
    "        this.gameEnv = gameEnv;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    update() {\n",
    "        const ctx = this.gameEnv.ctx;\n",
    "        ctx.drawImage(this.image, 0, 0, this.gameEnv.width, this.gameEnv.height);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    resize() {}\n",
    "    destroy() {}\n",
    "}\n",
    "export default Background;\n",
    "```\n",
    "There many instances of methods in my code, for example, the `destroy()` method above.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also many examples of instantiating objects, like:\n",
    "```js\n",
    "let quiz = new Quiz(); \n",
    "```\n",
    "An example of using objects and calling methods:\n",
    "```js\n",
    "dialogueSystem.showDialogue(...);\n",
    "gameInGame.start();\n",
    "```\n",
    "Parameters and return values:\n",
    "```js\n",
    "function customAlert(message, callback) { ... } \n",
    "// → takes parameters, may call `callback()` (a function)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coding Practices:\n",
    "*SRP, Object Literal, Object Instance, FSMs in Game, Inheritance*\n",
    "Single Responsibility Principle is a very important one when making classes--that each class or function is responsible for one thing. If you were to look at the different files in my adventureGame directory, you'd see that each file (class) has one single responsibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of an object literal:\n",
    "```js\n",
    "const sprite_data_guide = { ... };\n",

    "# How I've Showcased Projects\n",
    "A lot of the time, I've showcased projects with the rest of my group, which is great because it distributes the pressure of presenting. I've had to learn to quickly come up with answers to questions I wasn't prepared for, which has trained me to become a fast thinker. It's also helped me to get to know my code well; people are here to learn what I've created, and yes the demo is interesting, but what's behind the demo is equally as important, and it is crucial I know every bit of my code in order to fully and properly present it to others. This includes not only knowing what's written, but knowing the function of each and every part of code (like the data types above!)."
