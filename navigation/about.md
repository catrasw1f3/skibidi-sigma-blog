## About me!
Welcome to my "About" page! Here is some basic information about me.

## Family & Culture
My parents are Bangladeshi immigrants, but I've lived in San Diego my whole life. 
I do a few dance performances for Bangladeshi festivals every year or so. You can find them on my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@NamiraSharif). I have one (very annoying) younger brother, six cousins on my dad's side, two on my mom's. 5/8 of my cousins live back in Bangladesh.

## Hobbies/Interests
I like arts and crafts! I mostly make stuff out of wire or draw, but other forms of art are cool too. Cardboard and hot glue are my best friends.

Some of the wire crafts I've made:

Speaking of art, I really like any type of animation. I've been making  few small animations (that I will not be sharing here--I'm not THAT good yet) and have trying to get better. Some of my most favorite shows are cartoons/animation, including:
