Hi!! My name is Namira (she/her) and this is my blog. Some basic info about me: I love any type of art. I like drawing, crafting, and music. I love cooking and baking. Honestly I just like making things in general. I make a lot of things.
I LOVE fairies and anything fantasy-like. My favorite colors are green and purple, and I HATE the color blue. Strawberries are really cool. Same with cats.
